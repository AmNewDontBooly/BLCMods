A mod to remove the various usage of the slur for little people throughout the borderlands.
Only effects enemy name text, not quest text or audio.
Any inoffensive names like in UVHM for example were left alone.
If you don't like my replacement names, then sorry, but at least they aren't a slur anymore.

I was surprised nobody had done this yet until I looked into how to do it and realized why.
It's done now though, so I figured I may as well contribute it to the mods repo.

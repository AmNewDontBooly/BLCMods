# Funkzone 1.7
## This is Funkzone, a mod made by me which you might also know me by Funkotron9000. 

This is a silly rebalancing and overhaul mod made to really just make the game a mess. In its current state, Funkzone is a fast paced power trip meant to make the game feel like if you took Cruelty Squad and glued it to BL3! 
# THIS MOD REQUIRES COMMAND EXTENSIONS, AND SANITY SAVER.

I have added numerous pieces of new gear for you to mess with and touched up on many of the skill trees! Skill trees are somewhat vanilla but have some extra powerful effects.

For more specific information, check the changelog and damage formula that comes with the mod file.

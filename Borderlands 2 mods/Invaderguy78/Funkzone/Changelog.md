		QoL and Balance: This tab is somewhat confusing with the way I sorted it, so to be consise, i bunched it up into a few main catagories. You may want to read it in the actual mod file itself because it is more explanatory than this text file.

Balance: Concerned with numerical changes to enemies, the player character, or parts.

### DECEPTION BONUS NOW WORKS!!!

Loot Pools: Self explanatory, adjustments to either make the game easier to grind or to add some custom items to drop.

Quest Changes, and then Fixes. Most of the Fixes tab is stuff from patch I asked Shadow if I could borrow.

	

Enemy Adjustments Notable Features:
	-Raid Boss Health has been drastically reduced to compensate for a rework in the bee, and generally some of the raid bosses just being slightly reworked to make it less gear dependant, but 
	-UVHM Rebalanced by reducing enemy health.
	-ELEMENTAL EFFECTS REWORKED, CHECK DAMAGE FORMULA DOC
	-Faster Digistruct Enemy spawning thanks to ZetaDæmon.
	-Digi Peak enemies now have elemental matchups.
	

Bad Idea Central: You will figure out very quickly both why I have this section in this mod, and why I named it that. 

What the F**k Tab:
	This is basically just a ton of background changes that are mundane, or not mine. By that I mean they are changes I needed but probably could not figure out myself so I had to talk to more experienced people here. Or they are changes that I made to just make a few things work, or to test. Credit given to those I borrowed from that asked to be recognized.

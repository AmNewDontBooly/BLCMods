______________________________________________________________________________
Version 1.0.3a:

• Seraph Vendors and Seraphs were not dropping correctly from their respective sources. This has been fixed.

Version 1.0.3:

• Legendary rates in vendors were significantly toned down. The rate at which you had gotten these legendaries in vendors were too much, and it severely decreased the point of the mod, which is to go out, actively fight enemies, and get gear from them (Thanks Milk).

• EXP gains from enemies that were of a much higher level than you were significantly reduced (Thanks Milk).

• Further changes to weapon, grenade, and health vendors were made, including increasing the quality of IOTD (Item of the Day) items and removing skins from IOTD pools. Legendaries may still occasionally pop up as IOTD, but getting Legendaries in the actual spots of vendors is less likely to happen.

• The Unforgiven PS still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• New weapon named the Galahad. It can be acquired from Unmotivated Golem in DLC4 (Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep).

• New Maya Class Mod of Legendary Mantis.

• Increased BNK-3R's drop rates to get a Legendary.

• Increased the efficiency of Gaige's Shock Storm skill, by increasing its damage and doubling its effective radius, as well as proccing on Critical Hits AND Critical Kills.

• More Pep has been changed to give additional Shock Damage and Shock Status Effect Duration. Because of this change as well, and the redundancy between two skills, Wires Don't Talk has been lowered from 6% to 5% per grade.

• Topped Off for Sal has been changed to Law & Order. Previously, there was an unintended interaction with Topped Off and Big Bear, causing Sal to deal much more damage than listed. This has been changed to hopefully provide Sal with more survivability and gun damage outside of Gunzerking where he is weakest.

• Additionally, Gunzerking was not receiving bonuses from Last Longer. This has been fixed.

• New Pandorans in the Fight For Sanctuary DLC have been severely nerfed. Enemies will no longer have E-Tech weapons in favor of having just regular weapons, and their Shields and Health have been drastically reduced.

• Removed the Stock Market from the Pearl List and replaced with the Dark Army.

Version 1.0.2:

• The Striker SG still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• The Stomper AR still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• Further enhancements to difficulty levels, including enemy Grenade Damage, Shield Capacity, and Badass Spawn Rate. Hope you remember to bring a Shock weapon!

• Lowered the overall max levels of TVHM (all the way up to Thousand Cuts) so that you aren't so punished for pushing through the story.

• Fixed a bug where EXP levels past Level 50 were not being calculated correctly. Also fixed the falloff and catchup rate of EXP gains if you are overleveled/underleveled, respectively.

• Fight Fire With Fire on Axton has been changed to Scrappy. This provides Gun Damage, Accuracy, and Health Regeneration while moving.

• Upshot Robot now works correctly, and now gives Gun Damage and Shock Damage, as well as the normal Melee Damage.

• Characters who have Melee Overrides are now affected by their respective Action Skill Cooldown Skills. I.E. Maya's Quicken now increases Phasecast's Cooldown Rate, and Salvador's Smokin' Hot Barrel will increase Fistful of Hurt's Cooldown Rate.

• World Drop pools are now equalled out. Before, Grenades and Class Mods had a much higher chance of being able to world drop, with Guns and Shields being very little. This has been changed to hopefully see more World Drops of higher variety. World Drops in vendors and chests have been unaffected.

• New Zer0 Class Mod of Legendary Executioner.

• Pearls now have their correct rarity.

• Sawblade Technical now has its correct values increased (the targeted hotfix was not being applied correctly).

Version 1.0.1: 

• The Actualizer SMG was given an incorrect nerf to its Fire Rate. This has been fixed.

• Gwen's Head now properly shoots in a 6 round burst.

• Increased the difficulty of the difficulty options slightly. Each difficulty level now has extra enemy scaling, Normal at 0.25% damage per level, Hard at 0.5% damage per level, and Epic and Legendary with 1% damage scaling per level. This should hopefully balance out later levels so that they are a bit more challenging and less of a cakewalk.

• With the above being said, some damage reduction and Health Regen skills have been buffed to compensate. Able for Axton was increased from 0.6% per level to 1%. Battle Armor for Gaige has been increased from 4% per level to 5%. Sexual Tyrannosaurus for Sal was increased from 0.4% per level to 0.8%.

• There was an unintended interaction with Anarchy and Blood Soaked Shields, where activating Blood Soaked Shields with Anarchy would give you almost infinite Shield upkeep while it was activated. In order to stop this interaction, Anarchy has been completely reworked. Now on reloads, it gives you a chance to dramatically increase your own stats!

• Axton's Double Up now deals Incendiary Damage versus Slag.

• Weapon parts have been reworked. You should see some less dramatic changes when it comes to weapon parts now.

• Headhunters were reverted back to their original Level 15 counterparts, due to chest levels not being able to go lower than 15.

Version 1.0.0: Released mod. Yay!

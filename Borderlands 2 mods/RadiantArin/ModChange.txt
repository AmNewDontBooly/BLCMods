______________________________________________________________________________
Version 1.0.2:

• The Striker SG still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• The Stomper AR still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• Further enhancements to difficulty levels, including enemy Grenade Damage, Shield Capacity, and Badass Spawn Rate. Hope you remember to bring a Shock weapon!

• Lowered the overall max levels of TVHM (all the way up to Thousand Cuts) so that you aren't so punished for pushing through the story.

• Fixed a bug where EXP levels past Level 50 were not being calculated correctly. Also fixed the falloff and catchup rate of EXP gains if you are overleveled/underleveled, respectively.

• Fight Fire With Fire on Axton has been changed to Scrappy. This provides Gun Damage, Accuracy, and Health Regeneration while moving.

• Upshot Robot now works correctly, and now gives Gun Damage and Shock Damage, as well as the normal Melee Damage.

• Characters who have Melee Overrides are now affected by their respective Action Skill Cooldown Skills. I.E. Maya's Quicken now increases Phasecast's Cooldown Rate, and Salvador's Smokin' Hot Barrel will increase Fistful of Hurt's Cooldown Rate.

• World Drop pools are now equalled out. Before, Grenades and Class Mods had a much higher chance of being able to world drop, with Guns and Shields being very little. This has been changed to hopefully see more World Drops of higher variety. World Drops in vendors and chests have been unaffected.

• New Zer0 Class Mod of Legendary Executioner.

• Pearls now have their correct rarity.

• Sawblade Technical now has its correct values increased (the targeted hotfix was not being applied correctly).

Version 1.0.1: 

• The Actualizer SMG was given an incorrect nerf to its Fire Rate. This has been fixed.

• Gwen's Head now properly shoots in a 6 round burst.

• Increased the difficulty of the difficulty options slightly. Each difficulty level now has extra enemy scaling, Normal at 0.25% damage per level, Hard at 0.5% damage per level, and Epic and Legendary with 1% damage scaling per level. This should hopefully balance out later levels so that they are a bit more challenging and less of a cakewalk.

• With the above being said, some damage reduction and Health Regen skills have been buffed to compensate. Able for Axton was increased from 0.6% per level to 1%. Battle Armor for Gaige has been increased from 4% per level to 5%. Sexual Tyrannosaurus for Sal was increased from 0.4% per level to 0.8%.

• There was an unintended interaction with Anarchy and Blood Soaked Shields, where activating Blood Soaked Shields with Anarchy would give you almost infinite Shield upkeep while it was activated. In order to stop this interaction, Anarchy has been completely reworked. Now on reloads, it gives you a chance to dramatically increase your own stats!

• Axton's Double Up now deals Incendiary Damage versus Slag.

• Weapon parts have been reworked. You should see some less dramatic changes when it comes to weapon parts now.

• Headhunters were reverted back to their original Level 15 counterparts, due to chest levels not being able to go lower than 15.

Version 1.0.0: Released mod. Yay!

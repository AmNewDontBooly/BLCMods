# Funkzone
*v.1.3*

Funkzone is a mod focused primarily on the gear aspect of the game: rebalancing, reworking, or simply adding more gear to the game via **Sanity Saver**. My goal with this mod is to simply have a mod that borders the line between something of a joke, and a mod meant to make the game a new experience. With that comes changes to the endgame, skills, and of course gear.
